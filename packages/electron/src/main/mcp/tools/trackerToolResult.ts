 *
 * These tools declare no `workspacePath` and set no `additionalProperties:
 * false`, and nothing validates arguments (the MCP SDK types them as an open
 * record). So an argument that looks meaningful was silently dropped and the
 * tool answered confidently about a DIFFERENT workspace. Sibling tools on the
 * same endpoint -- tracker_set_issue_key_prefix, workspace_open,
 * workspace_set_trust -- do honour the parameter, which is exactly why a caller
 * learns it and passes it here.
 *
 * Rejecting is preferred over honouring: honouring opens cross-workspace access
 * questions, while a loud refusal costs one guard and never returns a plausible
 * wrong answer. Returns the error result to send back, or null when allowed.
